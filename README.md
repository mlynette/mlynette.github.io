> "Painting is just another way of keeping a diary."
<p>People made paintings to show their emotions and stories that no mouth can tell. Throughout centuries, art changed simultaneously, and so did the painting styles of humans. Some early painting styles date back to the 18th century and some styles were added through the next centuries. But they all share similarities; they show emotions and perspectives of diverse artists and they let us see the history of our changing world. Let us take a look at the 7 major painting styles that we recognize and use until today.</p>

Realism is a painting style in which the subject of the painting looks much like the real thing rather than being stylized or abstracted. It is the painting style that most people consider as "real art". When you look at it up close, you can see the different strokes and colors used to create the illusion of space and depth, setting, and the composition and lighting. Realism has been the dominant painting style since the Renaissance period.
